## Physics Undergraduate | Data Analyst
I am a 2nd year undergraduate studying Physics with Data Science. I have particular interests in:
- Statsistical Methods for Data Processing
- Efficient and Accurate Computational Methods
- Computational Physics

## Notable Projects
### The Starling Programming Language
[View Project](https://github.com/aurorusidk/starling)
- Implemented a strongly-typed, high-level programming language based in python
- Investigated and implemented compiled and interpreted execution methods

### Signal Whitening and Spectral Analysis
[View Project](https://github.com/MultipleNewts/ligo-merger-analysis)
- Investigated and implemented Welch's method, a FFT-based spectral density analysis to avoid time-dependence of noise
- Implemented data whitening techniques to reduce the presence of noise in a low signal-to-noise ratio dataset
- Benchmarked algorithm accuracy against libraries such as SciPy
- Ongoing.

### Computational Algorithms for Mathematical Functions
- Implemented the CORDIC algorithm for high-speed, high-accuracy computation of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions
- Benchmarked accuracy performance against NumPy
- Intended for implementation as a library into the Starling programming language

### Evolutionary Altruism
- Modelled the dynamics of survival strategy in a population
- Investigated limiting factors for dominance of various strategies, including: population ratio, reward matrix, and replacement amount

## Technical Skills
- Highly proficient in Python (including NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, GWpy)
- Familiar with web design languages (CSS, HTML, JavaScript)
- Familiar with Linux
